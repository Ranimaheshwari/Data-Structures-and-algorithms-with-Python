# Data Structures with Python 🐍

Welcome to the **Data Structures with Python** repository! This repository contains implementations of essential data structures in Python, with a focus on clean, efficient, and well-documented code.

## 📌 About
This repository is designed to help you understand and implement fundamental data structures using Python. Each data structure includes an explanation, code implementation, and sample test cases.

## 🏗️ Implemented Data Structures

### Linear Data Structures  
✅ Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly)  
✅ Stacks (Using Lists)  
✅ Queues (Simple, Circular, Deque, Priority Queue)  

### Non-Linear Data Structures
✅ Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, Trie)  
✅ Graphs (Adjacency List & Matrix, BFS, DFS)  
✅ Heaps (Min Heap, Max Heap)  
✅ Hash Tables (Custom HashMap & HashSet)  

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.7 or later recommended). You can check your Python version using:
```bash
python --version
```

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ranimaheshwari/Data-Structures-and-algorithms-with-Python.git
```

### Running the Code
Each data structure comes with test cases to validate its implementation. You can run them using:
```bash
python3 filename.py
```

Happy coding! 🚀
